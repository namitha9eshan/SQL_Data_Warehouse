DDL Script : Create Gold View 
====================================================================================================================================
Script Purpose : 
    This script creates views for the gold layer in the data warehouse. 
    The gold layer represents the final dimensions and fact tables (star schema)

    Each view performs transformations and combines data from the Silver layer 
    to produce a clean, enriched and business ready dataset 

Useage : 
 - These views can be queried directly for analytics and reporting.
